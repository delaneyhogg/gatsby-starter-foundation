I started running my social media as a business six years ago. This has spearheaded my interest in studying modern day social media in relation to diversity and inclusion efforts in the media.

I have a wide variety of interests. I love coffee, Chipotle, The Office, and more! My favorite types of coffee include:

1. Pumpkin Spice Lattes (YUMMY)
2. Cold Brew (to give me all of the energy)
3. Iced Coffee (to get me through classes)
